Project Title: FinSight AI – Financial Document Summarizer

FinSight AI is a web-based platform that helps users quickly understand and analyze multiple financial documents such as invoices, receipts, and bills. Users can upload up to 20 files at once, and the system uses AI to extract important information like dates, invoice numbers, taxes, and total amounts.

The platform allows users to generate summaries based on what they want to see, turning unstructured documents into clear, structured insights. It also provides simple graphical representations to help users easily track spending patterns, totals, and key financial details.

FinSight AI reduces the time and effort needed to manually read and analyze financial documents by converting them into meaningful summaries and visual insights.
